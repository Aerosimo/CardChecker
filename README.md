### PROJECT OVERVIEW

# Card Validation
> *Validating a credit card refers to the process of running a computer algorithm 
> that performs calculations using a credit card's number. 
> When the algorithm shows that the card is valid, it means only that the card number 
> is among those that could potentially exist with a given credit card company. 
> For example, a random series of numbers would likely result in an invalid answer 
> from the program, while an actual card number, even from a card that has expired 
> or reached its credit limit, would show up as valid, since the number is one that 
> the credit card company issued.*
